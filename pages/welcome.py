The **_social contract_** is a foundational concept in political philosophy, suggesting that individuals consent, either implicitly or explicitly, to form a so- ciety and abide by its rules, norms, and laws for mutual benefit. 

It posits that in exchange for giving up certain freedoms, individuals receive protection and order provided by the collective governance structure.
Historically articulated by philosophers, the social contract addresses questions of legitimacy, au- thority, and the origins of societal organisation. 

Right now, social inequalities, political polarisation, and breaches of trust between the governed and governing are calling into question the effectiveness and fairness of our current systems.

We wish to articulate this discourse with you, because all voices have a role.
