    How do different parties share understanding and tools for communication?

## Who is in the Social Contract?
 
 Think of the participants of the democratic process in ancient Greece, particularly in the city-state of Athens. While Athenian democracy is hailed as the birthplace of democracy, its scope of participation was limited to a relatively small portion of the population.

Only free adult men who were citizens of Athens could participate in the democratic process.

The Athenian democracy was a direct democracy, meaning eligible citizens participated in making laws and important decisions. 
Unlike modern representative democracies, where citizens elect officials to make decisions on their behalf, Athenian _themselves_ voted on every important issue.

Nowadays, the social contract has been a pact between the individual and the state in exchange for protection (of property, order, etc.).
    
Tomorrow, the Social Contract is an agreement that fulfills needs, and maybe instead of citizens we will feel like _planetizens_$^1$.

____

Remarks and References: 
‚Ä¢	Citizenship was inherited, meaning you needed to be born to Athenian parents to qualify.
‚Ä¢	These citizens had the right to vote, hold office, and participate in the Ekklesia (the assembly) and other democratic institutions like the Boule (the council).
